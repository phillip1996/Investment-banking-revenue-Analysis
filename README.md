## 🗂 Project Overview

Investment banks rely on accurate revenue analysis to identify profitable regions, sectors, and clients — helping bankers allocate resources, set targets, and build stronger relationships. In this project, I simulated an investment banking dataset representing deals across various regions, sectors, and relationship tiers, along with client profile information.

Using **advanced SQL queries**, I analyzed revenue distribution, average deal sizes, client performance relative to sector benchmarks, and revenue trends over time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Database:** MySQL
- **Languages:** SQL
- **Tools:** Power BI (planned for dashboarding)
- **Data:** Simulated investment banking revenue and client profile datasets

- Identify high-performing clients and sectors.
- Analyze deal trends over time.
- Provide clear metrics to support strategic decision-making.

This aligns with what I wrote on my resume:
